    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p> 1. In my personal life, I am working on myself and building character to aid other individuals. In my professional life, I am working towards OBGYN sonography because the aspect interests me and interacting with people for their future. 

2. For my personal life, I am reflecting on myself and my past actions, envisioning what I can do to change and impact others beneficially. For my professional life, I entered the job field, where I can interact with others and get to that feeling of working. 

3. Working on my personality and finding my character so I can appear joyful to others and have the patience with them. Developing technology and learning the system of sonographys and always something necessary to be successful.

4. Short-term goals I hope to accomplish in the future are being polite to others and listening to them. These short term goals will help me learn myself better and improve my mentality. 

5. I want to be most known for being joyful to others and building trust with my patients. I want to be recognized for my hard work, including my amazing personality I build towards others. </p>
